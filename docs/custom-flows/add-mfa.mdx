# Add multi-factor authentication to a user account

<Callout type="danger">
  This guide is for users who want to build a *custom* user interface using the Clerk API. To allow users to enable MFA for their account with a *prebuilt* UI, you should use Clerk's [User Profile page](/docs/account-portal/user-profile-org-profile#user-profile) or [`<UserProfile />`](/docs/components/user/user-profile) component.

Multi-factor verification (MFA) is an added layer of security that requires users to provide a second verification factor to access an account. For example, after entering a password, a user may be prompted to enter a one-time code sent to their phone or email.

When multi-factor authentication (MFA) is enabled for an application, authenticated users have the option to add MFA to their account. This guide will walk you through how to allow a signed in user to add MFA to their account.

## Next steps

Now that users can add MFA to their account, you may want to [build a custom sign-in flow that supports MFA](/docs/custom-flows/email-password-mfa).
