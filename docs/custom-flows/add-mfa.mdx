# Add multi-factor authentication to a user account

When multi-factor authentication (MFA) is enabled for an application, authenticated users can turn on MFA for their own account through their [User Profile](/docs/account-portal/user-profile-org-profile#user-profile) page. However, if you are building a custom user interface, you can use the Clerk API to build a custom user interface that allows users to add MFA to their account.

## Next steps

Now that users can add MFA to their account, you may want to [build a custom multi-factor sign-in flow](/docs/custom-flows/email-password-mfa) that allows users to sign in with MFA.
