# Add Multi-factor

Clerk supports multifactor authentication (MFA), often referred to as two-factor authentication or 2FA. By enabling MFA, you can encourage or require your users to perform a second verification check during sign-in.

The term multi-factor comes from the 3 main types of verifications:

- Knowledge-based - something you know, i.e. a password
- Possession-based - something you have, i.e. a phone or yubikey
- Inherent based - something you are, i.e. a fingerprint or a facial scan

By enforcing two different types of verifications, you can drastically improve your user's security. Most websites make this step optional, empowering their users with their own security.

## Before you start

- You need to create a Clerk Application in your [Clerk Dashboard](https://dashboard.clerk.com/). For more information, check out our [Set up your application](/docs/quickstarts/setup-clerk) guide.
- You need to install the correct SDK for your application. You can find steps on how to do so through Clerk's [quickstart](/docs/quickstarts/overview) guides.

## Configuration

Although not available as an option in the initial new application screen, you can opt to turn on multifactor authentication (MFA) from the configuration screen in the Clerk Dashboard. Go to **User & Authentication > [Multi-factor](https://dashboard.clerk.com/last-active?path=user-authentication/multi-factor)**.

Clerk currently offers the following MFA strategies:

- SMS verification code
- Authenticator application (also known as TOTP - Time-based One-time Password)
- Backup codes

Once MFA is turned on, registered users can turn on MFA for their own account through their [User Profile](/docs/account-portal/user-profile-org-profile#user-profile) page.
