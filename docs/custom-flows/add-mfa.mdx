# Enable multifactor authentication

Clerk supports multifactor authentication (MFA), often referred to as two-factor authentication or 2FA. By enabling MFA, you can encourage or require your users to perform a second verification check during sign-in.

The term multi-factor comes from the 3 main types of verifications:

- Knowledge-based: something you know, i.e. a password
- Possession-based: something you have, i.e. a phone or yubikey
- Inherent-based: something you are, i.e. a fingerprint or a facial scan

By enforcing two different types of verifications, you can drastically improve your user's security. Most websites make this step optional, empowering their users with their own security.

## Configuration

Although not available as an option in the initial new application screen, you can opt to turn on multifactor authentication (MFA) in your Clerk Dashboard. Go to **User & Authentication > [Multi-factor](https://dashboard.clerk.com/last-active?path=user-authentication/multi-factor)** to see a list of the available MFA strategies.

Clerk currently offers the following MFA strategies:

- SMS verification code
- Authenticator application (also known as TOTP - Time-based One-time Password)
- Backup codes

Once MFA is turned on, registered users can turn on MFA for their own account through their [User Profile](/docs/account-portal/user-profile-org-profile#user-profile) page.
