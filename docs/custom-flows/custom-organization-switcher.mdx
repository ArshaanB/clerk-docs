# Create a custom organization switcher

<Callout type="danger">
  This guide is for users who want to build a *custom* user interface using the Clerk API. To allow users to switch organizations with a *prebuilt* UI, you should use Clerk's [Account Portal pages](/docs/account-portal/overview) or [`<OrganizationSwitcher />`](/docs/components/organization/organization-switcher) component.
</Callout>

Users can be members of multiple organizations in Clerk. This guide will show you how to build a custom organization switcher using the [`useOrganizationList()`](/docs/references/react/use-organization-list) hook. This hook is used to fetch a list of organizations that the user is a member of, and it provides methods to load more organizations if they are available.

In the following example, 
- The `useOrganizationList()` hook is used to fetch `userMemberships`, which contains a `data` array of the user's organizations.
- The `data` array is mapped to render a list of organizations.
- A button is rendered for each organization, and when clicked, the `setActive()` method is called to switch the active organization. 
- A button is rendered to load more organizations, as the `data` array is paginated and will only return the first 10 results. When the button is clicked, the `fetchNext()` method is called to load more organizations, if they are available.

{/* TODO (Roy): Add JS examples (use Tabs for Nextjs vs JS). Use CodeBlockTabs and add examples for  NPM Module vs window.Clerk (Script) - see the /docs/components/user-button update I did in this PR */}

The example below is written for Next.js App Router, but it is supported by any React meta framework, such as Remix or Gatsby. 

To get started, create a new file called `OrganizationSwitcher.tsx` and paste the following code into it. You can place this file anywhere in your project, but in this example, it is placed in a folder called `components`.

```tsx filename="app/components/OrganizationSwitcher.tsx"
"use client"

import { useOrganizationList } from "@clerk/nextjs";

export const CustomOrganizationSwitcher = () => {
  const { isLoaded, setActive, userMemberships } = useOrganizationList({
    userMemberships: {
      infinite: true,
    },
  });

  if (!isLoaded) {
    return <p>Loading</p>;
  }

  return (
    <>
      <h2>Custom Organization Switcher</h2>
      <ul>
        {userMemberships.data?.map((mem) => (
          <li key={mem.id}>
            <span>{mem.organization.name}</span>
            <button
              onClick={() => setActive({ organization: mem.organization.id })}
            >
              Select
            </button>
          </li>
        ))}
      </ul>

      <button
        disabled={!userMemberships.hasNextPage}
        onClick={() => userMemberships.fetchNext()}
      >
        Load more organizations
      </button>
    </>
  );
};
```
