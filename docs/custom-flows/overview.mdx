# Building your custom UI with Clerk Hooks

If Clerk's [prebuilt components](/docs/components/overview) don't meet your specific needs or if you require more control over the authentication flow, Clerk enables you to build fully custom components using our hooks. There are three general categories of components you might build.


## Authentication UI

You can build custom sign up and sign in components, or even create a combined ui. 

### Sign-up flow

pYou can build your custom sign up component using the [useSignUp()](/docs/references/react/use-sign-up) hook. The `useSignUp()` hook enables you to build UI to handle any of the sign up methods Clerk offers. 

Clerk provides a flexible way to build sign-up flows in your application. You can use a single [`SignUp`][sign-up-ref] object to gather information, verify their email address or phone number, add OAuth accounts, and finally, convert them into a [`User`][user-ref].

Every [`SignUp`][sign-up-ref] has a set of requirements it must meet before it is turned into a [`User`][user-ref]. These requirements are defined by the instance settings you selected in the [Clerk Dashboard](https://dashboard.clerk.com/). Once all requirements are met, the [`SignUp`][sign-up-ref] will turn into a new [`User`][user-ref], and an active session for that [`User`][user-ref] will be created on the current [`Client`][client-ref].

Don't worry about collecting all the required fields at once and passing them to a single request. The API is designed to accommodate a progressive sign-up flow, often corresponding to multi-step sign-up forms.

### Sign-in flow

You can build your custom sign up component using the [useSignIn](/docs/references/react/use-sign-in) hook. With the `useSignIn()` hooks you can replicate the sign in methods Clerk offers and build your own UI to handle the process.

Sign-in's are initiated by creating a [`SignIn`][sign-in-ref] object on the current [`Client`][client-ref]. The [`SignIn`][sign-in-ref] handles all the state and logic associated with a sign-in. If the sign-in is successfully authenticated, it will transform into an active session on the current [`Client`][client-ref].

#### Completing a sign-in

There are 3 main steps a user must perform in order to complete a sign-in.

<Steps>

#### Identification

The first step a user needs to make is to identify what account they'd like to sign in to. This is done with an identifier, which can either be an email address, a phone number, or a username.

#### First factor verification

Once a user is identified, they need to prove their identity. This is the process of "authenticating" the user. There's a number of strategies a user can use to perform authentication with the most basic being the humble password. Other authentication strategies, like passwordless sign-in, can be explored in the [sign-in options documentation](/docs/authentication/configuration/sign-in-options). 

#### Second factor verification (optional)

This step only applies to users that have turned on two-factor authentication, also known as [multifactor authentication](/docs/custom-flows/mfa), for their user. 

When one form of verification isn't enough, trust two! Forcing two different verification steps vastly increases the security of your account. The most common setup a user will have to protect their account is using a password as their first kind of verification and a `phone_code` as their second kind of verification.

</Steps>

## Account Related Components

Do you want to build your own version of the [`<UserProfile />`](/docs/components/user/user-profile) component? Do you need to create a specific component just to to allow the user to add an OAuth account? Using the [`useUser()`](/docs/references/react/use-user) amd [`useClerk()`](/docs/references/react/use-clerk) hooks you can 

## Organization Compponents 

You can creare your own custom versions of Organization components using the [`useOrganization()`](/docs/references/react/use-organization) and [`useOrganizationList()`](/docs/references/react/use-organization-list) hooks.
