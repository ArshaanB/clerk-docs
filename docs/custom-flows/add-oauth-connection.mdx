# Add OAuth connection

<Callout type="danger">
  This guide is for users who want to build a *custom* user interface using the Clerk API. To allow users to add OAuth connections to their account with a *prebuilt* UI, you should use Clerk's [Account Portal pages](/docs/account-portal/overview) or [prebuilt components](/docs/components/overview).
</Callout>

To initiate an OAuth flow for a user that is already signed in, you can use the [`user.createExternalAccount(params)`](/docs/references/javascript/user/create-metadata#create-external-account) method, where `user` is a reference to the currently signed in user.

```jsx
user
  .createExternalAccount({ strategy: strategy, redirectUrl: 'your-redirect-url' })
  .then(externalAccount => {
    // navigate to
    // externalAccount.verification!.externalVerificationRedirectURL
  })
  .catch(err => {
    // handle error
  });
```
