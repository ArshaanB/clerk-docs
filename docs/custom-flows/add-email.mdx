# Add an email to a user's account

Users can have multiple email addresses associated with their account. Clerk's [`<UserProfile />`](/docs/components/user/user-profile) component allows users to add and verify new email addresses out of the box. However, if you are building a custom user interface, you can use the Clerk API to add and verify email addresses.

Adding a new email and verifying it for a user requires the following 4 steps:
1. Add the email to the user's account as unverified.
2. Load the `emailAddress` object for the new email
3. Use the `prepareVerification` method to send a verification email
4. Use the `attemptVerification` method to verify the user's new email address

In this example, the user is prompted to enter a new email address, and then the user is prompted to enter the OTP code that was sent to the new email address. The OTP code is used to verify the email during [first factor verification](https://clerk.com/docs/custom-flows/overview#factor-one-verification). You can use any verification strategy that you have set up in your Clerk settings. Read more about verification strategies on the [Sign in options](https://clerk.com/docs/authentication/configuration/sign-in-options) page.

{/* TODO (Roy): Add JS examples (use Tabs for Nextjs vs JS). Use CodeBlockTabs and add examples for  NPM Module vs window.Clerk (Script) - see the /docs/components/user-button update I did in this PR */}

The example below is written for Next.js App Router, but it is supported by any React meta framework, such as Remix or Gatsby. 

```tsx filename="app/add-email/page.tsx"
'use client';

import * as React from 'react';
import { useUser } from '@clerk/nextjs';
import { EmailAddressResource } from '@clerk/types';

export default function Page() {
  const { isLoaded, user } = useUser();
  const [email, setEmail] = React.useState('');
  const [code, setCode] = React.useState('');
  const [isVerifying, setIsVerifying] = React.useState(false);
  const [successful, setSuccessful] = React.useState(false);
  const [emailObj, setEmailObj] = React.useState<
    EmailAddressResource | undefined
  >();

  if (!isLoaded || !user) return null;

  const handleSubmit = async (e: React.FormEvent) => {
    e.preventDefault();

    // Add the new email to the user
    // Filter user.emailAddresses to get the object for the new email
    // Send the verification email -- this example uses an OTP code
    try {
      const res = await user.createEmailAddress({ email });
      await user.reload();
      const emailAddress = user.emailAddresses.find((a) => a.id === res.id);
      setEmailObj(emailAddress);
      emailAddress?.prepareVerification({ strategy: 'email_code' });
      setIsVerifying(true);
    } catch (error: any) {
      console.log(error);
    }
  };

  // Verify that the OTP code the user entered is correct
  // This will set the email to verified status
  const verifyCode = async (e: React.FormEvent) => {
    e.preventDefault();
    try {
      await emailObj?.attemptVerification({ code });
      setSuccessful(true);
    } catch (error) {
      console.log(error);
    }
  };

  // Show a success message.
  if (successful) {
    return (
      <>
        <Title variant="h1">Email Added</Title>
      </>
    );
  }

  // If the user has entered a new email, show the verification form
  if (isVerifying) {
    return (
      <>
        <h1>Verify Email</h1>
        <div>
          <form onSubmit={(e) => verifyCode(e)}>
            <div>

                onChange={(e) => setCode(e.target.value)}

                name="code"
                type="text"
                value={code}
              />
            </div>
            <div>
              <button type="submit">Verify</button>
            </div>
          </form>
        </div>
      </>
    );
  }

  // Prompt the user to enter the new email
  return (
    <>
      <h1>Add Email</h1>
      <div>
        <form onSubmit={(e) => handleSubmit(e)}>
          <div>
            <label htmlFor="email">Add Email</label>
            <input
              onChange={(e) => setEmail(e.target.value)}
              id="email"
              name="email"
              type="email"
              value={email}
            />
          </div>
